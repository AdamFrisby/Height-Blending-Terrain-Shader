# Height-Blending-Terrain-Shader
A simple height blending terrain shader for Unity3D. This shader still compiles to SM3 (unlike most more sophisticated height shaders).

This shader built for the Sine Space virtual world - but you can use it too.

Feel free to tear apart, the main modifications from the Unity default 'Standard Terrain' shader are in SplatmapMix() declared in TerrainSplatmapCommon.cginc
